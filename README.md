# vo2-mask
This project is to build a VO2 mask that is lightweight, easy to use, completely mobile (no reliance on metcarts, hoses, etc), and accurate enough to provide useful results for athletes and users who want to measure their VO2, VCO2 as well as other derived metrics like RER, EE, and caloric burn information (total calories, fat cal, carb cal.)
